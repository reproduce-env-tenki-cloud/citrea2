# Changelog

## v0.7.1 (2025-05-2)
Release for risc0 v2.0.2 fix for heap corruption bug.

Node operators need to rescan L1:

```sh
#Â use citrea-cli v0.7.1
citrea-cli --rollback --node-type fullnode --db-path path/to/db --l2-target 9999999999 --l1-target 74247 --sequencer-commitment-index 0

citrea-cli --clear-pending --db-path path/to/dbs 
```

## v0.7.0 (2025-04-18)
Release for Citrea Tangerine upgrade. Full nodes needs to be resynced.
- EVM Pectra support (except eip-2935)
- p256r1 precompile.
- Schnorr Verify precompile.
- Rewrite of EVM storage layout, resulting smaller state diffs.
- Rewrite of L2 block and transaction structures.
- Increased block gas limit to 10 million gas.
- Constant sized light client proof.


## v0.6.1 (2025-1-21)
- Fix LedgerDB migration process ([#1730](https://github.com/chainwayxyz/citrea/pull/1730))

## v0.6.0 (2025-1-20)
Citrea Kumquat upgrade will go live on testnet at block 5546000, activating many new features:
- EVM Cancun support.
  - BLOBBASEFEE returns 1 always as blob transactions are not supported.
  - KZG precompile is not activated.
- Offchain smart contracts.
  - Smart contract bytecodes are not committed to the state any more, reducing transaction costs when deploying smart contracts.
- Reduced diff size estimation by accounting for brotli compression discount, resulting in lower transaction costs for all transactions.
- Light client proofs are activated.
  - Succinct ZK proofs for any actor to know Citrea's final state trustlessly by verifying a single ZK proof.
