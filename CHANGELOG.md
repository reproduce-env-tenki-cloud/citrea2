# Changelog

## v0.6.1 (2025-1-21)
- Fix LedgerDB migration process ([#1730](https://github.com/chainwayxyz/citrea/pull/1730))

## v0.6.0 (2025-1-20)
Citrea Kumquat upgrade will go live on testnet at block 5546000, activating many new features:
- EVM Cancun support.
  - BLOBBASEFEE returns 1 always as blob transactions are not supported.
  - KZG precompile is not activated.
- Offchain smart contracts.
  - Smart contract bytecodes are not commited to the state any more, reducing transaction costs when deploying smart contracts.
- Reduced diff size estimation by accounting for brotli compression discount, resulting in lower transaction costs for all transactions.
- Light client proofs are activated.
  - Succinct ZK proofs for any actor to know Citrea's final state trustlessly by verifying a single ZK proof.
